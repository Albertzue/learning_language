## underpin
Observability doesn’t stop at the telemetry and analysis; it’s an organizational practice, similar to DevOps. 
In many ways, observability is the foundation of modern software development practices—it `underpins` everything we do, 
from continuous integration and deployment to chaos engineering, developer productivity, and more. 

## extrapolate
A big part of observing real systems involves identifying patterns of bad behavior and then `extrapolating` to figure out how certain patterns of transactions and resource consumption cause these patterns. 

## silo
This is the primary problem with the traditional three pillars approach: these signals are all kept in separate data `silos`. This makes it impossible to automatically identify correlations between changing patterns in our transaction logs and changing patterns in our metrics. Instead, you end up with three separate browser tabs, and each one contains only a portion of what you need.

if your telemetry data is `siloed`, unstructured, and inconsistent, then the assistance computers can offer you will be very limited.
